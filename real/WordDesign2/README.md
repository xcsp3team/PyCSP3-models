# Problem WordDesign2
## Description
See Problem 033 on CSPLib.

The problem is to find as large as possible a set S of strings (words) of length 8
over the alphabet W = { A,C,G,T } with the following properties:
 - each word in S has 4 symbols from { C,G }
 - each pair of distinct words in S differ in at least 4 positions
 - each pair of words x and y in S (where x and y may be identical) are such that
   xR and yC differ in at least 4 positions. Here, (x1,...,x8 )R = (x8,...,x1) is
   the reverse of (x1,...,x8) and (x1,...,x8)C is the Watson-Crick complement of
   (x1,...,x8), i.e. the word where each A is replaced by a T and vice versa
   and each C is replaced by a G and vice versa.

This problem has its roots in Bioinformatics and Coding Theory.
