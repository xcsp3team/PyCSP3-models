# Problem WwtppReal
## Description
Waste Water Treatment Plant Scheduling Problem.

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2010/2011 Minizinc challenges.
The MZN model was proposed by Miquel Bofill.
No Licence was explicitly mentioned (MIT Licence assumed).
