""" Comments
1) for posting Cumulative constraints in an alternative way, it would be less compact to write:
 def cumulative_for(k):
    origins, lengths, heights = zip(*[(s[i], duration, quantities[k]) for i, (duration, _, quantities) in enumerate(jobs) if quantities[k] > 0])
    return Cumulative(origins=origins, lengths=lengths, heights=heights)
 ...
 [cumulative_for(k) <= capacity for k, capacity in enumerate(capacities)]

2) in case of 1), using zip is compacter than writing something like:
 indexes = [i for i in range(nJobs) if jobs[i].requiredQuantities[k] > 0]
 origins = [s[i] for i in indexes]
 lengths = [jobs[i].duration for i in indexes]
 heights = [jobs[i].requiredQuantities[k] for i in indexes]
