"""
Problem of global coverage-path planning for linear-infrastructure inspection using multiple autonomous UAVs (Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones).
The problem is mathematically formulated as a variant of the Minâ€“Max K-Chinese Postman Problem (MM K-CPP) with multi-weight edges.

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2023 Minizinc challenge (directory multi-agent-graph-coverage).
The original MZN model seems to have been written by Peter Schneider-Kamp (MIT Licence assumed).

## Data
