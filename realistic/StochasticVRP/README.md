# Problem: StochasticVRP

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2014/2019 Minizinc challenges.
For the original MZN model, no licence was explicitly mentioned (MIT Licence assumed).

## Data Example
  s2-v2-c7.json

## Model
  constraints: [Circuit](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Circuit), [Element](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Element), [Sum](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Sum)

## Execution
```
  python StochasticVRP.py -data=<datafile.json>
```
