# Problem: ArithmeticTarget

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2022 Minizinc challenge.
The MZN model was proposed by Kelvin Davis, under the MIT Licence.

## Data Example
  0814.json

## Model
  constraints: [AllDifferent](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent), [Count](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Count), [Element](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Element)

## Execution
```
  python ArithmeticTarget.py -data=<datafile.json>
```
