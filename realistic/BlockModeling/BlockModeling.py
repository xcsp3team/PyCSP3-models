"""
Block modeling has a long history in the analysis of social networks.
The core problem is to take a graph and divide it into k clusters and interactions between those clusters described by a k Ã— k image matrix.

## Data Illustration
  kansas.json

## Model
  constraints: Sum

## Execution
  python BlockModeling.py -data=<datafile.json>
  python BlockModeling.py -data=[datafile.txt,number] -parser=BlockModeling_Parser.py
