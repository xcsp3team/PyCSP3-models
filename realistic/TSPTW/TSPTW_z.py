"""
Travelling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW).

From Lewander's paper cited below: Consider ùëõ locations that are to be visited, where there is a travelling duration between each directed
pair of locations and there is for each location u an earliest visiting time etu and a latest visiting time ltu.
A travelling salesperson tour with time windows (TSPTW ) of size ùëõ is a Hamiltonian path of the weighted directed graph induced by the ùëõ locations as nodes,
visiting each location u exactly once and between times etu and ltu.
The departure time at the last-visited location is to be minimised.

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2025 Minizinc challenge.
The original mzn model was proposed by  Frej Knutar Lewander (MIT Licence assumed).
