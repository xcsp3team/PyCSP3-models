# Problem: TSPTW

Travelling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW).

From Lewander's paper cited below: Consider ùëõ locations that are to be visited, where there is a travelling duration between each directed
pair of locations and there is for each location u an earliest visiting time etu and a latest visiting time ltu.
A travelling salesperson tour with time windows (TSPTW ) of size ùëõ is a Hamiltonian path of the weighted directed graph induced by the ùëõ locations as nodes,
visiting each location u exactly once and between times etu and ltu.
The departure time at the last-visited location is to be minimised.

This model is a simplified (but equivalent) version of TSPTW_z (submitted to the 2025 Minizinc challenge).
