"""
Soccer Computational Problem (Position in Ranking Problem).

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2018/2020 Minizinc challenges.
The original MZN model was proposed by Robinson Duque, Alejandro Arbelaez, and Juan Francisco DÃ­az.
No Licence was explicitly mentioned (MIT Licence is assumed).

## Data Example
  22-12-22-5.json

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferent, Sum, Table

## Execution
  python Soccer.py -data=<datafile.json>
  python Soccer.py -data=<datafile.dzn> -parser=Soccer_ParserZ.py

""" Comments
1) We can now write iPoints[i] + Sum(...) but it introduces auxiliary variables 
 [iPoints[i] + Sum(points[j][0] if i == games[j][0] else points[j][1] for j in range(numberOfGames) if i in games[j]) == score[i] for i in range(n)]
2) Warning: length(games) in Minizinc returns the number of elements in the array and not the number of rows.
