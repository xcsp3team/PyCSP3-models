# Problem MultiKnapsack

The Multi dimensional knapsack problem was originally proposed as an optimization problem by the OR community.
Here, it is the feasability version, as used, e.g., in (Refalo, CP 2004) and (Pesant et al., JAIR 2012).

## Data Example

  python MultiKnapsack.py -data=<datafile.json> -parser=MultiKnapsack_Parser.py
```
