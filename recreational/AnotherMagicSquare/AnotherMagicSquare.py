"""
On a square grid of size n Ã— n, all numbers ranging from 1 to n*n must be put so that the numbers surrounding each number add to a multiple of that number.

## Data
  A unique integer n

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferent, Sum

1) There are 0, 8 and 0 solutions for n = 2, 3 and 4
2) For being compatible with the competition mini-track, we use:
   # y[i,j] is the multiple used for the cell at row i and column j
   y = VarArray(size=[n, n], dom=range(1, 8*(n * n) + 1))
