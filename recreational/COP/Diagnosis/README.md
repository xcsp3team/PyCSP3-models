# Problem Diagnosis
## Description
See Problem 042 on [CSPLib](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob042/).

Model-based diagnosis can be seen as taking as input a partially parameterized structural description of a system and a set of observations about that system. Its output is a set of assumptions which, together with the structural description, logically imply the observations, or that are consistent with the observations.
