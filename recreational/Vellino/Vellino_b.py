This configuration problem involves putting components of different materials (glass, plastic, steel, wood, and copper)
into bins of various types/colors (red, blue, green), subject to capacity (each bin type has a maximum capacity) and compatibility constraints.
Every component must be placed into a bin and the total number of used bins must be minimized.
The compatibility constraints are:
 - red bins cannot contain plastic or steel
 - blue bins cannot contain wood or plastic
 - green bins cannot contain steel or glass
 - red bins contain at most one wooden component
 - green bins contain at most two wooden components
 - wood requires plastic
 - glass excludes copper
 - copper excludes plastic

## Data Example

## Model

""" Comments
1) Writing capacities = [0] + capacities is not possible because the new built list 
   is there not from the specific type of list we need. One would need to call
   the function cp_array

2) Posting a LexMatrix does not seem to be correct from the perspective of the model
   (to be checked)
