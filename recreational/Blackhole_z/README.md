# Problem Blackhole_z
## Description
Black Hole Patience game

The model, below, is close to (can be seen as the close translation of) the one submitted to the 2009/2011/2013 Minizinc challenges.
The MZN model was proposed by Mikael Zayenz Lagerkvist (with what seems to be a MIT Licence).
The instances (used in the challenges) have been generated by the black hole patience model in the Gecode distribution.
