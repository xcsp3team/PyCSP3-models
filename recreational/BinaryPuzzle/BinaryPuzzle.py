"""
A binary puzzle (also known as a binary Sudoku) is a puzzle played on an n Ã— n grid;
initially some of the cells may contain 0 or 1 (but this is not the case for the 2023 competition).
One has to fill the remaining empty cells with either 0 or 1 according to the following rules:
  -  no more than two similar numbers next to or below each other are allowed,
  -  each row and each column should contain an equal number of zeros and ones,
  - each row is unique and each column is unique.

## Data
  A unique integer n

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferentList, Regular, Sum

## Execution
  python BinaryPuzzle.py -data=number
  python BinaryPuzzle.py -data=number -variant=regular

""" Comments
1) For XCSP competitions, before 2024, we needed to discard or translate in tables (calling .to_table())
   the AllDifferentList constraints
2) For finding a first solution, the regular model is far more efficient (at least with default heuristics)
  (a few seconds for n=50, 60 or 70)  
3) For being compatible with the competition mini-track, we use for the main variant:
   [Sum(x[i, j:j + 3]) >= 1 for i in range(n) for j in range(n - 2)],
   [Sum(x[i, j:j + 3]) <= 2 for i in range(n) for j in range(n - 2)],
4) We can write:
   [Sum(x[i, j:j + 3]) in {1,2} for i in range(n) for j in range(n - 2)], 
5) Data for the 2023 competition are: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120]
