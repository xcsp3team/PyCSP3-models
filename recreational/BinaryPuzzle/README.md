# Problem: BinaryPuzzle

A binary puzzle (also known as a binary Sudoku) is a puzzle played on an n Ã— n grid;
initially some of the cells may contain 0 or 1 (but this is not the case for the 2023 competition).
One has to fill the remaining empty cells with either 0 or 1 according to the following rules:
  -  no more than two similar numbers next to or below each other are allowed,
  -  each row and each column should contain an equal number of zeros and ones,
  - each row is unique and each column is unique.
