"""
The purpose of the game is to fill a grid of size n Ã— n with all values ranging from 1 to n*n such that:
  - if the next number in the sequence is going to be placed vertically or horizontally, then it must be placed exactly three squares away
  from the previous number (there must be a two square gap between the numbers);
  - if the next number in the sequence is going to be placed diagonally, then it must be placed exactly two squares away
  from the previous number (there must be a one square gap between the numbers).

## Data
  a unique integer n

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferent, Count, Table
