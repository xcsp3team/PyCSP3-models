"""
On a board of size n×m, you have to put square tiles (pieces) that are described by four colors (one for each direction : top, right, bottom and left).
All adjacent tiles on the board must have matching colors along their common edge. All edges must have color ’0’ on the border of the board.

## Data (example)
  07x05.json

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferent, Extension, Intension

## Execution
  - python Eternity.py -data=07x05.json
