# Problem All-Interval Series 

## Description 

Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c\#, d, $\dots$), represented by numbers $0,1,\dots,11$, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly once and in which the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).
That is, for each of the intervals, there is a pair of neighboring pitch-classes in the series, between which this interval appears.

Elliott Carter often bases his all-interval sets on the list generated by Bauer-Mendelberg and Ferentz and uses them as a "tonic" sonority.

The problem of finding such a series can be easily formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem.
Given a positive integer $n$, find a sequence $x = \langle x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1} \rangle$, such that:
- $x$ is a permutation of $\{0,1,...,n-1\}$;
- the interval sequence <span>$y = \langle |x_1-x_0|, |x_2-x_1|, ... |x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}| \rangle$</span> is a permutation of $\{1,2,...,n-1\}$.

A sequence satisfying these conditions is called an all-interval series of order $n$; the problem of finding such a series is the all-interval series problem of order $n$.



## Example

For $n=8$, a solution is:
```
    1 7 0 5 4 2 6 3
```


## Data 
a number n, the size of the sequence.

## Model 

A model can be found in this [GitHub page](https://github.com/xcsp3team/pycsp3/blob/master/problems/csp/academic/AllInterval.py).
There are a main variant and another one (called aux) with auxiliary variables.

You can also find a step-by-step modeling process in this [Jupyter notebook](/documentation/models/CSP/AllInterval/).
