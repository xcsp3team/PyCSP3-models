# Problem Pigeons

The classical "Pigeon-hole" problem.
It can be useful to test the efficiency of filtering/reasoning algorithms.

## Data
  An integers n

## Model
  There are two variants: a main one, and a variant "dec"

  constraints: [AllDifferent](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent)

## Execution:
```
  python Pigeons.py -data=number
  python Pigeons.py -data=number -variant=dec
```
