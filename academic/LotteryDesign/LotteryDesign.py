"""
X is a set of balls labelled 1 to d.
Find a set B of n tickets each containing m of these numbers, such that for any draw D of p distinct
balls from X, we can find at least one ticket B âˆˆ B which matches D in at least t places.

Important: the model, below, does not exactly correspond to this statement (it was written for the 2025 XCSP3 competition).

## Data
   five numbers: d, m, p, t, n

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferentList

## Execution
  python LotteryDesign.py -data=[number,number,number,number,number]
