# Problem: LotteryDesign

X is a set of balls labelled 1 to d.
Find a set B of n tickets each containing m of these numbers, such that for any draw D of p distinct
balls from X, we can find at least one ticket B âˆˆ B which matches D in at least t places.

Important: the model, below, does not exactly correspond to this statement (it was written for the 2025 XCSP3 competition).

## Data

## Model
  constraints: [AllDifferentList](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferentList)

## Execution
```
  python LotteryDesign.py -data=[number,number,number,number,number]
```
