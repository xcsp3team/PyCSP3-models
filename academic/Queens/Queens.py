"""
This is [Problem 054](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob054/) at CSPLib.

Can n queens (of the same colour) be placed on a n√ón chessboard so that none of the queens can attack each other?

## Example
  A solution for n=8
 ![Queens](http://pycsp.org/assets/notebooks/figures/queens.png)

## Data
  A number n, the size of the board.

## Model
  You can find a step-by-step modeling process in this [Jupyter notebook](https://pycsp.org/documentation/models/CSP/Queens/).

  There are 3 variants of this problem, one with AllDifferent constraints, the other ones with constraint in intension.

  constraints: AllDifferent

## Execution
  - python Queens.py -data=number
  - python Queens.py -data=number -variant=v1
  - python Queens.py -data=number -variant=v2

## Tags
