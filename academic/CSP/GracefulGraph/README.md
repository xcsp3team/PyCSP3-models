# Problem GracefulGraph
## Description
This is the [problem 053](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob053/) of the CSPLib:

"*A labelling f of the nodes of a graph with q edges is graceful if f assigns each node a unique label from 0, 1...,q
and when each edge (x,y) is labelled with |f(x)âˆ’f(y)|, the edge labels are all different.*"


### Example
Here, is a solution of a $K_4$.

## Data
A couple [k,p] where k is the size of each clique and p is the size of each path (the number of clique).

## Model(s)
  constraints: [AllDifferent](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent), [Intension](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Intension)

## Command Line


```shell
  python3 GracefulGraph.py
  python3 GracefulGraph.py -data=[3,5]
