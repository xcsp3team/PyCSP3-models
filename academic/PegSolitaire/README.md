# Problem PegSolitaire

Peg Solitaire is played on a board with a number of holes.
In the English version of the game considered here, the board is in the shape of a cross with 33 holes.
Pegs are arranged on the board so that at least one hole remains. By making horizontal or vertical draughts-like moves,
the pegs are gradually removed until a goal configuration is obtained.
In the classic ‘central’ Solitaire, the goal is to reverse the starting position, leaving just a single peg in the central hole
