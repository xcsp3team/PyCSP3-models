# Problem LowAutocorrelation

This is [Problem 005](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob005/) at CSPLib.

These problems have many practical applications in communications and electrical engineering.
The objective is to construct a binary sequence length n that minimizes the autocorrelations between bits.
Each bit in the sequence takes the value +1 or -1.

## Data
  A number n, the length of the sequence.

## Model
  constraints: [Sum](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Sum)

## Execution
  - python LowAutocorrelation.py -data=number
