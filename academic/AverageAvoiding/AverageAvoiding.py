""" Comments
1) We should be able to post Cardinality while being able to recognize a AllDif at compÃ®lation time when it is the case
2) TODO use -1 instead of 0 and fix the problem data=-1 => we get a str instead of an int
3) Data used for the 2024 Competition: [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65]
