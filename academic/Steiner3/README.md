# Problem: Steiner3

This is [Problem 044](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob044/) at CSPLib:

The ternary Steiner problem of order n consists of finding a set of n.(nâˆ’1)/6 triples of distinct integer
elements in {1...n} such that any two triples have at most one common element.

## Example
  A solution for n=7 is:
 ```((1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 5, 7), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 6))```

## Data
  A number n, the number of integers.

## Model
  constraints: [Table](https://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Table)

## Execution
```
  python Steiner3.py -data=number
```
