# Problem DakotaFurniture
## Description
The Dakota Furniture Company manufactures desks, tables, and chairs.
The manufacture of each type of furniture requires lumber and two types of skilled labor: finishing and carpentry.
The amount of each resource needed to make each type of furniture is given in the following table

  - Resource        Desk  Table Chair
  - Lumber           8     6     1
  - Finishing hours  4     1     1.5
  - Carpentry hours  2     1.5   0.5

Currently, 48 board feet of lumber, 20 finishing hours, and 8 carpentry hours are available.
A desk sells for $60, a table for $30, and a chair for $20.
Dakota believes that demand for desks and chairs is unlimited, but at most five tables can be sold.
Because the available resources have already been purchased, Dakota wants to maximize total revenue.
