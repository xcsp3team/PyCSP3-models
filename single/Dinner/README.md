# Problem: Dinner

My son came to me the other day and said, "Dad, I need help with a math problem."
The problem went like this:
 - We're going out to dinner taking 1-6 grandparents, 1-10 parents and/or 1-40 children
 - Grandparents cost $3 for dinner, parents $2 and children $0.50
 - There must be 20 total people at dinner, and it must cost $20
How many grandparents, parents and children are going to dinner?
