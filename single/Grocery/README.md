# Problem Grocery

A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items.
The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says:
"Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them;
  I'll try again;
  Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11 ".
What were the prices of the four items?
