Dad wants one-cent, two-cent, three-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent stamps.
He said to get four each of two sorts and three each of the others, but I've forgotten which.
He gave me exactly enough to buy them; just these dimes.
How many stamps of each type does Dad want?
A dime is worth ten cents.

1) [1, 2, 3, 5, 10] * s cannot work (because the list of integers if not built from cp_array)
   one should write: cp_array(1, 2, 3, 5, 10) * s

2) there are two solutions
