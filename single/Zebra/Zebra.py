The Zebra puzzle (sometimes referred to as Einstein's puzzle) is defined as follows.
There are five houses in a row, numbered from left to right.
Each of the five houses is painted a different color, and has one inhabitant.

We know that:
 - colors are yellow, green, red, white, and blue
 - nations of inhabitants are italy, spain, japan, england, and norway
 - pets are cat, zebra, bear, snails, and horse
 - drinks are milk, water, tea, coffee, and juice

 - the painter owns the horse
 - the diplomat drinks coffee
 - the one who drinks milk lives in the white house
 - the Spaniard is a painter
 - the Englishman lives in the red house
 - the snails are owned by the sculptor
 - the green house is on the left of the red one
 - the Norwegian lives on the right of the blue house
