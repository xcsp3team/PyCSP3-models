"""
Four friends (two women named Debra and Janet, and two men named Hugh and Rick) found that each of them is allergic to something different:
eggs, mold, nuts and ragweed.
We would like to match each one's surname (Baxter, Lemon, Malone and Fleet) with his or her allergy.
We know that:
 - Rick is not allergic to mold
 - Baxter is allergic to eggs
 - Hugh is neither surnamed Lemon nor Fleet
 - Debra is allergic to ragweed
 - Janet (who isn't Lemon) is neither allergic to eggs nor to mold
