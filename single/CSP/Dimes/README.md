# Problem Dimes
## Description
Dad wants one-cent, two-cent, three-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent stamps.
He said to get four each of two sorts and three each of the others, but I've
forgotten which. He gave me exactly enough to buy them; just these dimes."
How many stamps of each type does Dad want? A dime is worth ten cents.
-- J.A.H. Hunter
