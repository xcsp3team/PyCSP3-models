A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items.
The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says
``Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them;
  I'll try again;
  Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11''.
What were the prices of the four items?

1) in some models of the literature, sometimes, the product is decomposed as for example:
  y = VarArray(size=2, dom=range(71100))
