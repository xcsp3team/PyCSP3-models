"""
There are 13 words as follows:
``buoy, cave, celt, flub, fork, hemp, judy, junk, limn, quip, swag, visa, wish ``
There are 24 different letters that appear in the 13 words.
The question is: can one assign the 24 letters to 4 different cubes so that the four letters of each word appears on different cubes.
There is one letter from each word on each cube.
The puzzle was created by Humphrey Dudley.
