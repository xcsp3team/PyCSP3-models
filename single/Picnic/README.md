# Problem Picnic

Five friends (three women named Mindy, Sabrina and Tanya and two men named Anton and Chet) agreed to meet on an island
in the middle of the bay for a picnic lunch on Sunday.
Each arrived on a different type of conveyance (jet-ski, kayak, outrigger canoe, sailboard, and sailboat),
and each brought a different beverage (beer, juice, soda, water and wine)
and a different food (bread, cheese, cookies, fish and salad) to share with the others.
We know that:
 - Mindy and the person who arrived on the jet-ski brought, in some order, beer and soda.
 - The five people are Chet, the person who arrived by kayak, and the people who brought the fish, water and wine.
 - The person who brought the salad didn't bring the wine.
 - Sabrina and the person who brought the cheese are, in some order, the person who arrived by outrigger canoe and the one who brought the beer.
 - A woman brought bread and juice.
 - The person who arrived by sailboat is not the person who brought the soda and the other person who brought the cookies.
