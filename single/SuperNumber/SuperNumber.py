"""
We are looking for the 10-digit number which satisfies the following conditions:
  - all digits from 0-9 occur exactly once
  - the first 2 digits are divisible by 2
  - the first 3 digits are divisible by 3
  - ...
  - the first 10 digits are divisible by 10

Using divisibility rules allows us to use less expensive operations (constraints), but a less compact model.

## Data
  all integrated (single problem)

## Model
  constraints: AllDifferent, Sum

## Execution
  python SuperNumber.py
  python SuperNumber.py -variant=rules

""" Comments
1) we directly set 0 for the last digit (because it must be divisible by 10)
   as a valid alternative, we could have written [x[:i] * [10 ** (i - j - 1) for j in range(i)] % i == 0 for i in range(2, 11)]
   but this generates still bigger integers (for example, not managed by Choco 4.10.5 and ACE)
